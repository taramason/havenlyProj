# havenlyProj
Set up a webpack project to both serve a React site locally for development and build a bundle for production.

**The development environment should include:**

*Support for CSS Modules **DONE**

*Hot Module Reloading **DONE**

*Proxying of asset requests to a different URL (you do not need to implement a dev server to respond to proxied requests, if they 404 that will be good enough). **NEED TO IMPLEMENT**

*Your production build config should include:

*Dead code elimination **DONE**

*Any necessary polyfills **DONE**

*Code minification **DONE**

*Source maps **DONE?**

*Feel free to copy and paste from any previous webpack configs you've done, but please do not use a pre-built template like create-react-app or react-slingshot.

**90% DONE, Need to make responsive:**

*Build the following page design to match the responsive.png mock-up as closely as you can. Use the React/webpack project set up in the last question. We don't have a mobile mock for this page, but be sure to build it mobile-first and make your own decisions about how to display the layout at that size.

*The page shown on the mock is the max-width - if a user's screen is wider than 1150px, the page should be the size shown and centered in the browser.

**NEXT**

Take a look at the attached mockups, and assume you're being assigned to build them â€“ but, for some reason, have been given very little information. These are screenshots of a feature that a Havenly designer uses to show a room design concept, and its products, to a user.

Answer the following questions:

*What are the most important questions you have about the mocks and how they should work?

*What seems like, potentially, the biggest unknown?

*What changes would you recommend making to make this interface work well on mobile?

**NEXT**

Write a function that takes two arrays full of objects and outputs a list of their changes, as seen below.

You can assume that the IDs of the objects will be persistent, but other values won't be. Don't assume that "name" and "quantity" are the only values to diff.

**I HAVE NOT STARTED THIS**
